## Explanation of Problem 3: Huffman Coding


**Design Decisions:**
I primarily used Dictionaries to store data as it allows for an `O(1)` runtime.
The Priority Queue, along with Node having a frequency parameter, allowed me to keep track
of the frequencies of each letter. This helped in creating the Tree when having the pop the least
frequent letter.
I decided to store the binary codes in the Tree itself so I didnâ€™t need to return anything in
`Tree.create_binary_codes`.


**Time Complexity:**
`O(n)` since I constantly run through the initial data when determining frequencies, building the
priority queue, building the tree, creating the compressed data, and decompressing the data.


**Space Complexity:**
`O(n)` from storing the binary codes, priority queue, frequencies.
The rest of the data stored is `O(1)`.
