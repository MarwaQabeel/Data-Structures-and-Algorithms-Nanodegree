## Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

- The algorithm runs in a single pass through the input using a counter for the `input_list`. 


- The `input_list` consist only of index 0,1 and 2. The programs will sort the such array in a single traversal, if the component of such is index 0 ( this one will represent where the following 0 will be inserted such as to the left side) , index 2( represents where the index 2 will be inserted such as to the right side) it will skip is the component is one.


- The time complexity being O(n) and the space complexity if of O(n).
