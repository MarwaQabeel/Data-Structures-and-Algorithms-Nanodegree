## Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

- In this problem we approach that was utilized was to break or split a path which is
Dependent on / as a rundown. Like the autocomplete Trie, the rundown of the components represent the
Character of the word and of course, the RouteTrie enforced Router. 


- The complexity of RouteTrie for finding and Embedding capacity is O(n) were n is the length for road_listing and the space complexity of Router happens to be O(n) in which n is the length for 
road_listing
