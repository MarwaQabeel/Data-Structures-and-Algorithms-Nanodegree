## Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

- 2 classes working with are `TrieNode` and `Trie`.


- `TrieNode` is the representation of a hub or node in a Trie “diagram”


- The complexity of TrieNode = O(n*m)
```
n = length of children
m = the repetition depth
```

- The complexity of a Trie ins funct is O(n)
```
n = length of word.
```
- The complexity of a Trie discover or find function is O(m)
```
m = length of prefix
```

- Moreover, the autocomplete algorithm of a Trie is equal to O(n*m) and the time 
Complexity = O(n)
